        <article>“Blue Lock’s way of football isn’t about teamwork first — it’s about ego. They believe the strongest striker is one who can create goals on their own. Players are trained to sharpen their individual weapons: insane speed, perfect positioning, deadly accuracy, or wild instincts. In Blue Lock, passing is a choice, not a necessity. It’s all about crushing the opponent, seizing the spotlight, and evolving into the ultimate striker — someone who can change the game with one touch. That’s the Blue Lock way.”
